# irg
`irg` is an R package for calculating the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG). It can be used to fit a double logistic curve to a time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and calculate IRG, as described in Bischoff et al. (2012) [[1]](#references). Remote sensing imagery from MODIS is collected frequently with high temporal resolution (albeit with lower spatial resolution than LANDSAT). IRG helps identify the timing of green-up and can be used to determine if migratory animals are "surfing" a green-wave of high quality forage or if non-migratory animals are selecting available resources at the peak IRG in their environments. 

## Approach
The `irg` package opts for a tabular calculation of IRG as opposed to a raster based approach. Sampling MODIS imagery is left up to the user and a prerequisite for all functions. The main input (`DT`) for all functions is a [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) of an NDVI time series. The sampling unit (`id`) is flexible (a decision for the user) though we would anticipate points or polygons, or maybe a pixel. All functions leverage the speed of `data.table` to efficiently filter, scale, and model NDVI time series and calculate IRG. 

More details in the first vignette: [Getting started with IRG](). 


## Installation

Install with [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes). 

```{r}
remotes::install_gitlab('robit.a/irg')
```

## Usage

IRG is calculated by filtering an NDVI time series, scaling variables, modeling the time series with a double logistic curve and taking the first derivative of this curve. 

Here, we use the meta function `irg`. Alternatively, use the filtering, scaling, modeling and IRG functions separately (see [Getting started with IRG]()). 

```{r ggIRG, eval = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(irg)

# Load package data
ndvi <- fread(system.file("extdata", "ndvi.csv", package = "irg"))

# Calculate IRG using example data: a raw NDVI time series
IRG <- irg(ndvi)

# Plot one year for one individual (please excuse the manual color scale)
ggplot(IRG[yr == 2007 & id == 12377]) +
	geom_line(aes(t, irg, color = '#14c62f'), show.legend = TRUE) +
	geom_line(aes(t, fitted, color = '#47694d'), show.legend = TRUE) +
	scale_color_identity("", labels = c('NDVI', 'IRG'), guide = 'legend') + 
	labs(y = '')
```
