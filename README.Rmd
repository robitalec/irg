# irg
`irg` is an R package for calculating the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG).
It can be used to fit a double logistic curve to a time series of normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI) and calculate IRG, as described in Bischoff
et al. (2012) [[1]](#references). IRG helps identify the timing of green-up and
can be used to determine if migratory animals are "surfing" a green-wave of high
quality forage or if non-migratory animals are selecting available resources at
the peak IRG in their environments. 

~~At the moment, the `irg` package is designed to work with MODIS imagery, but
we're working on adding other sensors~~. Update: we recently added an example
Landsat 8 dataset. The `irg` package functions have been updated to be more
flexible to different sensors. Let us know (open an issue!) if you use a sensor
other than MODIS for calculating IRG. Thanks!



## Approach
The `irg` package opts for a tabular calculation of IRG as opposed to a raster
based approach. Sampling imagery is left up to the user and a prerequisite
for all functions. The main input (`DT`) for all functions is a
[`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) of an NDVI time series.
The sampling unit (`id`) is flexible (a decision for the user) though we would
anticipate points or polygons, or maybe a pixel. All functions leverage the
speed of `data.table` to efficiently filter, scale, and model NDVI time series
and calculate IRG.

More details in the first vignette: 
[Getting started with IRG](https://robitalec.github.io/irg/articles/getting-started-with-irg.html). 


## Installation

Install with CRAN

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install 
install.packages('irg')
```

or R-universe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Enable the robitalec universe
options(repos = c(
    robitalec = 'https://robitalec.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Install 
install.packages('irg')
```



## Usage

IRG is calculated by filtering an NDVI time series, scaling variables, modeling
the time series with a double logistic curve and taking the first derivative of
this curve.

Here, the example uses  use the meta function `irg`. Generally, users should opt
for the individual filtering, scaling, modeling and irg functions separately to
tweak settings and column names (see 
[Getting started with IRG](https://robitalec.github.io/irg/articles/getting-started-with-irg.html)).

```{r ggIRG, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(irg)

# Load package data
ndvi <- fread(system.file("extdata", "sampled-ndvi-MODIS-MOD13Q1.csv", package = "irg"))

# Filter and scale NDVI
filter_ndvi(ndvi)
scale_ndvi(ndvi)
scale_doy(ndvi)

# Guess starting parameters
model_start(ndvi, id = 'id', year = 'yr')

# Double logistic model parameters given starting parameters for nls
mods <- model_params(
  ndvi,
  returns = 'models',
  id = 'id', year = 'yr',
  xmidS = 'xmidS_start', xmidA = 'xmidA_start',
  scalS = 0.05,
  scalA = 0.01
)

# Fit double log to NDVI
fit <- model_ndvi(mods, observed = FALSE)

# Calculate IRG for each day of the year
calc_irg(fit)

# Plot IRG and NDVI for 1 year at 1 point
cols <- c('IRG' = '#14c62f', 'NDVI' = '#47694d')

random_yr <- sample(fit$yr, 1)
random_id <- sample(fit$id, 1)

ggplot(fit[yr == random_yr & id == random_id], aes(x = t)) +
	geom_line(aes(y = irg, color = 'IRG')) +
	geom_line(aes(y = fitted, color = 'NDVI')) +
	geom_point(aes(y = scaled), data = ndvi[yr == random_yr & id == random_id]) + 
	scale_color_manual(values = cols) +
	labs(y = '', color = '')
```
