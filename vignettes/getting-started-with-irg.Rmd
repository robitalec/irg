IRG is intended to be used with a `data.table` time seris of NDVI samples for multiple years. 

ID can be point ID, polygon ID, etc. Any sampling unit you are using which is relevant to the calculation of IRG. 

We don't use raster methods on purpose to take advantage of `data.table` speed. If you want to visualize your results, make single graphs (see vignette-graphing TODO and maybe a raster graphing vignette TODO).
